Problem 1:
---
Imagine you've got a pizza in front of you, and that the pizza has n slices. 
Each slice has a different amount of cheese on it, and you want to maximise
how much cheese you eat. The only problem is:

* You can't eat the whole thing, because you'll get full after k slices.
* You're a strict follower of Pizza Etiquitte. After you take the first 
  slice, you can only take slices adjacent to slices you've already taken.

Can you come up with an algorithm that specifies which slices you should eat 
to maximize the amount of cheese you eat before you get full?

test one:   2, 4, 6, 3, 1, 1
test two:   5, 5, 2, 4, 3, 5
test three: 5, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6
test four:  1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1; k = 5
test five:  1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1; k = 6
